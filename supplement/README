🗒️`CV_MG.py`, `CV_PR.py`, `CV_PR+GP.py` are scripts for training and evaluating models with cross validation
🗒️`LH_MG.py`, `LH_PR.py`, `LH_PR+GP.py` are scripts for training and evluating models with the task that uses data gathered from low pressure and low temperature 
for the prediction under high pressure or high temperature conditions.
